Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

### What is Forking on GitHub?  
- **Forking** creates a copy of someone else’s repository in your own GitHub account.  
- It allows you to experiment with changes without affecting the original project.  
- Changes can be contributed back via **pull requests**.  


### Forking vs. Cloning  
| Aspect         | Forking                                      | Cloning                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**    | Copies the repository to your GitHub account | Downloads the repository to your local system |
| **Connection** | Maintains a link to the original repository  | No link to the original repository             |
| **Contributions** | Changes can be proposed via pull requests | Changes remain local unless manually shared    |
| **Use Case**   | Contributing to public projects              | Local development or backups                   |


### When to Use Forking  
1. **Contributing to Open Source:**  
   - Fork a public repo, make changes, and create a pull request to contribute back.  

2. **Experimentation and Customization:**  
   - Safely experiment with features or customizations without affecting the original code.  

3. **Maintaining Personal Versions:**  
   - Keep a personalized version of a project, especially if it diverges from the main branch.  

4. **Collaborating with Limited Access:**  
   - If you don’t have push access, you can still contribute by forking and submitting pull requests.
